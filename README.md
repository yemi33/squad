# Squad — Central AI Development Team

A multi-project AI dev team that runs from `~/.squad/`. Five autonomous agents share a single engine, dashboard, knowledge base, and MCP toolchain — working across any number of linked repos with self-improving workflows.

Inspired by and initially scaffolded from [Brady Gaster's Squad](https://bradygaster.github.io/squad/).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **Claude Code CLI** — install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Anthropic API key** or Claude Max subscription (agents spawn Claude Code sessions)
- **Git** — agents create worktrees for all code changes

## Installation

```bash
# Clone to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/yemi33/squad.git ~/.squad
cd ~/.squad
```

No `npm install` needed — Squad uses only Node.js built-in modules.

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Initialize the squad (creates config.json with default agents)
node ~/.squad/squad.js init

# 2. Link your projects (interactive — prompts for name, description, repo config)
node ~/.squad/squad.js add C:\path\to\repo1
node ~/.squad/squad.js add C:\path\to\repo2

# 3. Start the engine (runs in foreground, ticks every 60s)
node ~/.squad/engine.js

# 4. Open the dashboard (separate terminal)
node ~/.squad/dashboard.js
# → http://localhost:7331
```

### What happens on first run

1. The engine starts ticking every 60 seconds
2. It scans each linked project for work: PRs needing review, PRD gaps, queued work items
3. If it finds work and an agent is idle, it spawns a Claude Code session with the right playbook
4. You can watch progress on the dashboard or via `node engine.js status`

To give the squad its first task, open the dashboard Command Center and add a work item, or use the CLI:
```powershell
node ~/.squad/engine.js work "Explore the codebase and document the architecture"
```

## What It Does

- **Auto-discovers work** from PRD gaps, pull requests, and work queues across all linked projects
- **Dispatches AI agents** (Claude CLI) with full project context, git worktrees, and MCP server access
- **Routes intelligently** — fixes first, then reviews, then implementation, matched to agent strengths
- **Learns from itself** — agents write findings, engine consolidates into institutional knowledge
- **Tracks quality** — approval rates, error rates, and task metrics per agent
- **Shares workflows** — agents create reusable skills (Claude Code-compatible) that all other agents can follow
- **Supports cross-repo tasks** — a single work item can span multiple repositories
- **Fan-out dispatch** — broad tasks can be split across all idle agents in parallel, each assigned a project
- **Auto-syncs PRs** — engine scans agent output for PR URLs and updates project trackers automatically
- **Auto-extracts skills** — agents write ` ```skill ` blocks in output; engine auto-extracts them
- **Heartbeat monitoring** — detects dead/hung agents via output file activity, not just timeouts
- **Auto-cleanup** — stale temp files, orphaned worktrees, zombie processes cleaned every 10 minutes

## Dashboard

The web dashboard at `http://localhost:7331` provides:

- **Projects bar** — all linked projects with descriptions (hover for full text)
- **Command Center** — add work items (per-project, auto-route, or fan-out), decisions, and PRD items
- **Squad Members** — agent cards with status, click for charter/history/output detail panel
  - **Live Output tab** — real-time streaming output for working agents (auto-refreshes every 3s)
- **Work Items** — paginated table with status, source, type, priority, assigned agent, linked PRs, fan-out badges, and retry button for failed items
- **PRD** — gap analysis stats + progress bar with item-level breakdown and linked PRs per item
- **Pull Requests** — paginated PR tracker sorted by date, with review/build/merge status
- **Skills** — agent-created reusable workflows (squad-wide + project-specific), click to view full content
- **Decisions Inbox + Active Decisions** — learnings and team rules
- **Dispatch Queue + Engine Log** — active/pending work and audit trail
- **Agent Metrics** — tasks completed, errors, PRs created/approved/rejected, approval rates

## Project Config

When you run `squad.js add <dir>`, it prompts for project details and saves them to `config.json`. Each project entry looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "MyProject",
  "description": "What this repo is for — agents read this to decide where to work",
  "localPath": "C:/Users/you/MyProject",
  "repoHost": "github",
  "repositoryId": "",
  "adoOrg": "your-github-org",
  "adoProject": "",
  "repoName": "MyProject",
  "mainBranch": "main",
  "workSources": {
    "prd":          { "enabled": true, "path": "docs/prd-gaps.json" },
    "pullRequests": { "enabled": true, "path": ".squad/pull-requests.json" },
    "workItems":    { "enabled": true, "path": ".squad/work-items.json" }
  }
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `description` — critical for auto-routing. Agents read this to decide which repo to work in.
- `repoHost` — `"ado"` (Azure DevOps) or `"github"`. Controls which MCP tools agents use for PR creation, review comments, and status checks. Defaults to `"ado"`.
- `repositoryId` — required for ADO (the repo GUID), optional for GitHub.
- `adoOrg` — ADO organization or GitHub org/user.
- `adoProject` — ADO project name (leave blank for GitHub).
- `workSources` — toggle which work sources the engine scans for each project.

The init script also creates `<project>/.squad/` with empty `work-items.json` and `pull-requests.json`.

## MCP Server Integration

Agents need MCP tools to interact with your repo host (create PRs, post review comments, etc.). On engine start, MCP servers are auto-synced from `~/.claude.json` to `mcp-servers.json`.

**Example:** If you use Azure DevOps, configure the `azure-ado` MCP server in your Claude Code settings. If you use GitHub, configure the `github` MCP server. Agents will discover and use whichever tools are available.

Manually refresh with `node engine.js mcp-sync`.

## Work Items

All work items use the shared `playbooks/work-item.md` template, which provides consistent branch naming, worktree workflow, PR creation steps, and status tracking.

**Per-project** — scoped to one repo. Select a project in the Command Center dropdown.

**Central (auto-route)** — agent gets all project descriptions and decides where to work. Use "Auto (agent decides)" in the dropdown, or `node engine.js work "title"`. Can span multiple repos.

### Fan-Out (Parallel Multi-Agent)

Set Scope to "Fan-out (all agents)" in the Command Center, or add `"scope": "fan-out"` to the work item JSON.

The engine dispatches the task to **all idle agents simultaneously**, assigning each a project (round-robin). Each agent focuses on their assigned project and writes findings to the inbox.

```
"Explore all codebases and write architecture doc"  scope: fan-out
       │
       ├─→ Ripley   → Project A
       ├─→ Lambert  → Project B
       ├─→ Rebecca  → Project C
       └─→ Ralph    → Project A (round-robin wraps)
```

### Failed Work Items

When an agent fails (timeout, crash, error), the engine marks the work item as `failed` with a reason. The dashboard shows a **Retry** button that resets it to `pending` for re-dispatch.

## Auto-Discovery Pipeline

The engine discovers work from 5 sources, in priority order:

| Priority | Source | Dispatch Type |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | PRs with changes-requested | `fix` |
| 2 | PRs pending review | `review` |
| 3 | PRD items (missing/planned) | `implement` |
| 4 | Per-project work items | item's `type` |
| 5 | Central work items | item's `type` |

Each item passes through: dedup (checks pending, active, AND recently completed), cooldown, and agent availability gates. See `docs/auto-discovery.md` for the full pipeline.

## Agent Execution

### Spawn Chain

```
engine.js
  → spawn node spawn-agent.js <prompt.md> <sysprompt.md> <args...>
    → spawn-agent.js resolves claude-code cli.js path
      → spawn node cli.js -p --system-prompt <content> <args...>
        → prompt piped via stdin (avoids shell metacharacter issues)
```

No bash or shell involved — Node spawns Node directly. Prompts with special characters (parentheses, backticks, etc.) are safe.

### What Each Agent Gets

- **System prompt** — identity, charter, history, project context, critical rules, skill index, team decisions
- **Task prompt** — rendered playbook with `{{variables}}` filled from config
- **Working directory** — project root (agent creates worktrees as needed)
- **MCP servers** — all servers from `~/.claude.json` via `--mcp-config`
- **Full tool access** — all built-in tools plus all MCP tools
- **Permission mode** — `bypassPermissions` (no interactive prompts)
- **Output format** — `stream-json` (real-time streaming for live dashboard + heartbeat)

### Post-Completion

When an agent finishes:
1. Output saved to `agents/<name>/output.log`
2. Agent status updated (done/error)
3. Work item status updated (done/failed)
4. PRs auto-synced from output → project's `pull-requests.json`
5. Agent history updated (last 20 tasks)
6. Quality metrics updated
7. Review feedback created for PR authors (if review task)
8. Learnings checked in `decisions/inbox/`
9. Skills auto-extracted from ` ```skill ` blocks in output
10. Temp files cleaned up

## Team

| Agent | Role | Best for |
|-------|------|----------|
| Ripley | Lead / Explorer | Code review, architecture, exploration |
| Dallas | Engineer | Features, tests, UI |
| Lambert | Analyst | PRD generation, docs |
| Rebecca | Architect | Complex systems, CI/infra |
| Ralph | Engineer | Features, bug fixes |

Routing rules in `routing.md`. Charters in `agents/{name}/charter.md`. Both are editable — customize agents and routing to fit your team's needs.

## Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `work-item.md` | Shared template for all work items (central + per-project) |
| `implement.md` | Build a PRD item in a git worktree, create PR |
| `review.md` | Review a PR, post findings to repo host |
| `fix.md` | Fix review feedback on existing PR branch |
| `analyze.md` | Generate PRD gap analysis in a worktree |
| `explore.md` | Read-only codebase exploration |
| `test.md` | Run tests and report results |

All playbooks use `{{template_variables}}` filled from project config. The `work-item.md` playbook uses `{{scope_section}}` to inject project-specific or multi-project context. Playbooks are fully customizable — edit them to match your workflow.

## Health Monitoring

### Heartbeat Check (every tick)

Uses `live-output.log` file modification time as a heartbeat:
- **Process alive + recent output** → healthy, keep running
- **Process alive + silent >5min** → hung, kill and mark failed
- **No process + silent >5min** → orphaned (engine restarted), mark failed

Agents can run for hours as long as they're producing output. The `heartbeatTimeout` (default 5min) only triggers on silence.

### Automated Cleanup (every 10 ticks)

| What | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| Temp prompt/sysprompt files | >1 hour old |
| `live-output.log` for idle agents | >1 hour old |
| Git worktrees for merged/abandoned PRs | PR status is `merged`/`abandoned`/`completed` |
| Orphaned worktrees | >24 hours old, no active dispatch references them |
| Zombie processes | In memory but no matching dispatch |

Manual cleanup: `node engine.js cleanup`

## Self-Improvement Loop

Five mechanisms that make the squad get better over time:

### 1. Learnings Inbox → decisions.md
Agents write findings to `decisions/inbox/`. Engine consolidates at 5+ files into `decisions.md` — categorized (reviews, feedback, learnings, other) with one-line summaries. Auto-prunes at 50KB. Injected into every future playbook.

### 2. Per-Agent History
`agents/{name}/history.md` tracks last 20 tasks with timestamps, results, projects, and branches. Injected into the agent's system prompt so it remembers past work.

### 3. Review Feedback Loop
When a reviewer flags issues, the engine creates `feedback-<author>-from-<reviewer>.md` in the inbox. The PR author sees the feedback in their next task.

### 4. Quality Metrics
`engine/metrics.json` tracks per agent: tasks completed, errors, PRs created/approved/rejected, reviews done. Visible in CLI (`status`) and dashboard with color-coded approval rates.

### 5. Skills
Agents save repeatable workflows to `skills/<name>.md` with Claude Code-compatible frontmatter. Engine builds an index injected into all prompts. Skills can also be stored per-project at `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (requires a PR). Visible in dashboard alongside decisions.

See `docs/self-improvement.md` for the full breakdown.

## Configuration Reference

Engine behavior is controlled via `config.json`. Key settings:

```json
{
  "engine": {
    "tickInterval": 60000,
    "maxConcurrent": 3,
    "agentTimeout": 600000,
    "staleThreshold": 1800000,
    "maxTurns": 100,
    "inboxConsolidateThreshold": 5
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `tickInterval` | 60000 (1min) | Milliseconds between engine ticks |
| `maxConcurrent` | 3 | Max agents running simultaneously |
| `agentTimeout` | 600000 (10min) | Kill agents silent longer than this |
| `staleThreshold` | 1800000 (30min) | Kill stale dispatch entries |
| `maxTurns` | 100 | Max Claude CLI turns per agent session |
| `inboxConsolidateThreshold` | 5 | Inbox files needed before consolidation |

## Node.js Upgrade Caution

The engine and all spawned agents use the Node binary that started the engine (`process.execPath`). After upgrading Node, restart the engine:

```powershell
node ~/.squad/engine.js stop
node ~/.squad/engine.js
```

## Portability

**Portable (works on any machine):** Engine, dashboard, playbooks, charters, routing, decisions, skills, docs, work items.

**Machine-specific (reconfigure per machine):**
- `config.json` — contains absolute paths to project directories. Re-link via `node squad.js add <dir>`.
- `mcp-servers.json` — auto-synced from `~/.claude.json` on engine start.

To move to a new machine: clone `~/.squad/`, delete `engine/control.json`, re-run `node squad.js add` for each project.
