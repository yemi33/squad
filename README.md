# Squad — Autonomous AI Development Team

A multi-project AI dev team that runs from `~/.squad/`. Five autonomous agents share a single engine, dashboard, knowledge base, and MCP toolchain — working across any number of linked repos with self-improving workflows.

Zero dependencies — uses only Node.js built-in modules.

Inspired by and initially scaffolded from [Brady Gaster's Squad](https://bradygaster.github.io/squad/).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (LTS recommended)
- **Claude Code CLI** — install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Anthropic API key** or Claude Max subscription (agents spawn Claude Code sessions)
- **Git** — agents create worktrees for all code changes

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally from npm
npm install -g @yemi33/squad

# Bootstrap ~/.squad/ with default config and agents
squad init

# Link your first project (interactive — auto-detects from git remote)
squad add ~/my-project
```

Or try without installing:

```bash
npx @yemi33/squad init
```

No dependencies — Squad uses only Node.js built-in modules.

**Alternative: clone directly**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yemi33/squad.git ~/.squad
node ~/.squad/squad.js init
```

## Upgrading

```bash
# Check if an update is available
squad version

# Update the npm package and apply changes
npm update -g @yemi33/squad
squad init --force
```

**What gets updated:** Engine code (`.js`, `.html`), new playbooks, new agent charters, new docs, `CHANGELOG.md`.

**What's preserved:** Your `config.json`, agent history, notes, knowledge base, routing, skills, and any `.md` files you've customized (charters, playbooks). If a new playbook or charter is added in an update, it's installed automatically without touching your existing ones.

Upgrades now skip the interactive repo scan automatically. If you want to re-run discovery later, run `squad scan`. To skip scanning during the very first install, pass `--skip-scan` and link projects manually when ready.

**What's shown:** A summary of files updated, added, and preserved, plus a pointer to the changelog.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Init + scan — finds all git repos on your machine, multi-select to add
squad init
#    → creates config, agents, engine defaults
#    → scans ~ for git repos (auto-detects host, org, branch)
#    → shows numbered list, pick with "1,3,5-7" or "all"

# 2. Start the engine (runs in foreground, ticks every 60s)
squad start

# 3. Open the dashboard (separate terminal)
squad dash
# → http://localhost:7331
```

You can also add/scan repos later:
```bash
squad scan              # Re-scan and add more repos
squad scan ~/code 4     # Scan specific dir, depth 4
squad add ~/repo        # Add a single repo interactively
```

## Setup via Claude Code

If you use Claude Code as your daily driver, you can set up Squad by prompting Claude directly:

**First-time setup:**
```
Install squad with `npm install -g @yemi33/squad`, run `squad init`,
then link my project at ~/my-project with `squad add ~/my-project` —
answer the interactive prompts using what you can auto-detect from the repo.
```

**Give the squad work:**
```
Add a work item to my squad: "Explore the codebase and document the architecture"
— run `squad work "Explore the codebase and document the architecture"`
```

**Check status:**
```
Run `squad status` and tell me what my squad is doing
```

### What happens on first run

1. The engine starts ticking every 60 seconds
2. It scans each linked project for work: PRs needing review, plan items, queued work items
3. If it finds work and an agent is idle, it spawns a Claude Code session with the right playbook
4. You can watch progress on the dashboard or via `squad status`

To give the squad its first task, open the dashboard Command Center and add a work item, or use the CLI:
```bash
squad work "Explore the codebase and document the architecture"
```

## What It Does

- **Auto-discovers work** from plans (`plans/*.json`), pull requests, and work queues across all linked projects
- **Plan pipeline** — `/plan` spawns a plan agent, chains to plan-to-prd, produces `plans/{project}-{date}.json` with `status: "awaiting-approval"`. Supports shared-branch and parallel strategies.
- **Human approval gate** — plans require approval before materializing as work items. Dashboard provides Approve / Discuss & Revise / Reject. Discussion launches an interactive Claude Code session.
- **Dispatches AI agents** (Claude CLI) with full project context, git worktrees, and MCP server access
- **Routes intelligently** — fixes first, then reviews, then implementation, matched to agent strengths
- **LLM-powered consolidation** — Haiku summarizes notes (threshold: 5 files). Regex fallback. Source references required.
- **Knowledge base** — `knowledge/` with categories: architecture, conventions, project-notes, build-reports, reviews. Full notes preserved. Dashboard browsable with inline Q&A.
- **Token tracking** — per-agent and per-day usage. Dashboard Token Usage panel.
- **Engine watchdog** — dashboard auto-restarts dead engine.
- **Agent re-attachment** — on restart, finds surviving agent processes via PID files.
- **Learns from itself** — agents write findings, engine consolidates into institutional knowledge
- **Tracks quality** — approval rates, error rates, and task metrics per agent
- **Shares workflows** — agents create reusable skills (Claude Code-compatible) that all other agents can follow
- **Supports cross-repo tasks** — a single work item can span multiple repositories
- **Fan-out dispatch** — broad tasks can be split across all idle agents in parallel, each assigned a project
- **Auto-syncs PRs** — engine scans agent output for PR URLs and updates project trackers automatically. PR reconciliation sweep catches any missed PRs from ADO.
- **Human feedback on PRs** — comment on any ADO PR to trigger agent fix tasks. `@squad` keyword required when multiple humans are commenting; optional when you're the only reviewer.
- **Dependency-aware spawning** — when a work item depends on others, the engine merges dependency PR branches into the worktree before the agent starts
- **Plan verification** — when all PRD items complete, engine auto-dispatches a verify task that builds all repos, starts the webapp, and writes a manual testing guide
- **PRD modification** — edit plans via doc-chat in the modal, then "Generate PRD" to regenerate. Dashboard supports regenerating, retrying failed items, and syncing edits to pending work items.
- **Auto-extracts skills** — agents write ` ```skill ` blocks in output; engine auto-extracts them
- **Heartbeat monitoring** — detects dead/hung agents via output file activity, not just timeouts
- **Auto-cleanup** — stale temp files, orphaned worktrees, zombie processes cleaned every 10 minutes

## Dashboard

The web dashboard at `http://localhost:7331` provides:

- **Projects bar** — all linked projects with descriptions (hover for full text)
- **Command Center** — add work items, notes, plans (multi-project via `#project` tags). "make a plan for..." auto-detection, "remember" keyword, `--parallel`/`--shared` flags, arrow key history, Past Commands modal.
- **Squad Members** — agent cards with status and result summary, click for charter/history/output detail panel
  - **Live Output tab** — real-time streaming output for working agents (auto-refreshes every 3s)
- **Work Items** — paginated table with status, source, type, priority, assigned agent, linked PRs, fan-out badges, and retry button for failed items
- **Plans** — plan approval UI with Approve / Discuss & Revise / Reject. Click to open in doc-chat modal for natural language editing; "Generate PRD" button appears after edits.
- **Knowledge Base** — browsable by category with inline Q&A (Haiku-powered)
- **PRD Progress** — dependency graph view, per-item retry button, "Edit PRD" and "Regenerate" actions. Failed items show green retry button.
- **Token Usage** — per-agent and per-day token tracking, plus engine LLM usage (command-center, doc-chat, consolidation)
- **Pull Requests** — paginated PR tracker sorted by date, with review/build/merge status
- **Skills** — agent-created reusable workflows (squad-wide + project-specific), click to view full content
- **Notes Inbox + Team Notes** — learnings and team rules, editable from dashboard modal
- **Dispatch Queue + Engine Log** — active/pending work and audit trail
- **Agent Metrics** — tasks completed, errors, PRs created/approved/rejected, approval rates
- **Document modals** — inline Q&A with Haiku on any document modal

## Project Config

When you run `squad add <dir>`, it prompts for project details and saves them to `config.json`. Each project entry looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "MyProject",
  "description": "What this repo is for — agents read this to decide where to work",
  "localPath": "C:/Users/you/MyProject",
  "repoHost": "github",
  "repositoryId": "",
  "adoOrg": "your-github-org",
  "adoProject": "",
  "repoName": "MyProject",
  "mainBranch": "main",
  "workSources": {
    "pullRequests": { "enabled": true, "path": ".squad/pull-requests.json" },
    "workItems":    { "enabled": true, "path": ".squad/work-items.json" }
  }
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `description` — critical for auto-routing. Agents read this to decide which repo to work in.
- `repoHost` — `"ado"` (Azure DevOps) or `"github"`. Controls which MCP tools agents use for PR creation, review comments, and status checks. Defaults to `"ado"`.
- `repositoryId` — required for ADO (the repo GUID), optional for GitHub.
- `adoOrg` — ADO organization or GitHub org/user.
- `adoProject` — ADO project name (leave blank for GitHub).
- `workSources` — toggle which work sources the engine scans for each project.

Per-project runtime state is stored centrally at `~/.squad/projects/<project-name>/work-items.json` and `~/.squad/projects/<project-name>/pull-requests.json`.

### Auto-Discovery

When you run `squad add`, the tool automatically detects what it can from the repo:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Main branch | `git symbolic-ref` |
| Repo host | Git remote URL (github.com → `github`, visualstudio.com/dev.azure.com → `ado`) |
| Org / project / repo | Parsed from git remote URL |
| Description | First non-heading line from `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` |
| Project name | `name` field from `package.json` |

All detected values are shown as defaults in the interactive prompts — just press Enter to accept or type to override.

### Project Conventions (CLAUDE.md)

When dispatching agents, the engine reads each project's `CLAUDE.md` and injects it into the agent's system prompt as "Project Conventions". This means agents automatically follow repo-specific rules (logging, build commands, coding style, etc.) without needing to discover them each time. Each project can have different conventions.

## MCP Server Integration

Agents need MCP tools to interact with your repo host (create PRs, post review comments, etc.). Agents inherit MCP servers directly from `~/.claude.json` as Claude Code processes — add servers there and they're immediately available to all agents on next spawn.

**Example:** If you use Azure DevOps, configure the `azure-ado` MCP server in your Claude Code settings. If you use GitHub, configure the `github` MCP server. Agents will discover and use whichever tools are available.

Manually refresh with `squad mcp-sync`.

### Azure DevOps Users

For the best experience with ADO repos, install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and use the [Azure DevOps MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp). This gives agents full access to PRs, work items, repos, and pipelines via MCP tools — no `gh` CLI needed.

```bash
# Install Azure CLI
winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI   # Windows
brew install azure-cli               # macOS
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash  # Linux

# Login and set defaults
az login
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG project=YOUR_PROJECT
```

Then add the ADO MCP server to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude.json`). The engine will auto-sync it to all agents on next start.

## Work Items

All work items use the shared `playbooks/work-item.md` template, which provides consistent branch naming, worktree workflow, PR creation steps, and status tracking.

**Per-project** — scoped to one repo. Select a project in the Command Center dropdown.

**Central (auto-route)** — agent gets all project descriptions and decides where to work. Use "Auto (agent decides)" in the dropdown, or `squad work "title"`. Can span multiple repos.

### Fan-Out (Parallel Multi-Agent)

Set Scope to "Fan-out (all agents)" in the Command Center, or add `"scope": "fan-out"` to the work item JSON.

The engine dispatches the task to **all idle agents simultaneously**, assigning each a project (round-robin). Each agent focuses on their assigned project and writes findings to the inbox.

```
"Explore all codebases and write architecture doc"  scope: fan-out
       │
       ├─→ Ripley   → Project A
       ├─→ Lambert  → Project B
       ├─→ Rebecca  → Project C
       └─→ Ralph    → Project A (round-robin wraps)
```

### Failed Work Items

When an agent fails (timeout, crash, error), the engine marks the work item as `failed` with a reason. The dashboard shows a **Retry** button that resets it to `pending` for re-dispatch.

## Auto-Discovery Pipeline

The engine discovers work from 5 sources, in priority order:

| Priority | Source | Dispatch Type |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | PRs with changes-requested | `fix` |
| 2 | PRs with human `@squad` feedback | `fix` |
| 3 | PRs with build failures | `fix` |
| 4 | PRs pending review | `review` |
| 5 | PRs needing build/test verification | `test` |
| 6 | Plan items (`plans/*.json`, approved) | `implement` |
| 7 | Per-project work items | item's `type` |
| 8 | Central work items | item's `type` |

Each item passes through: dedup (checks pending, active, AND recently completed), cooldown, and agent availability gates. See `docs/auto-discovery.md` for the full pipeline.

## Agent Execution

### Spawn Chain

```
engine.js
  → spawn node spawn-agent.js <prompt.md> <sysprompt.md> <args...>
    → spawn-agent.js resolves claude-code cli.js path
      → spawn node cli.js -p --system-prompt <content> <args...>
        → prompt piped via stdin (avoids shell metacharacter issues)
```

No bash or shell involved — Node spawns Node directly. Prompts with special characters (parentheses, backticks, etc.) are safe.

### What Each Agent Gets

- **System prompt** — lean (~2-4KB) identity + rules only
- **Task prompt** — rendered playbook with `{{variables}}` filled from config, plus bulk context (charter, history, project context, active PR/dispatch context, team notes). Skills/KB are referenced by path and loaded on-demand.
- **Working directory** — project root (agent creates worktrees as needed)
- **MCP servers** — inherited from `~/.claude.json` (no extra config needed)
- **Full tool access** — all built-in tools plus all MCP tools
- **Permission mode** — `bypassPermissions` (no interactive prompts)
- **Output format** — `stream-json` (real-time streaming for live dashboard + heartbeat)

### Post-Completion

When an agent finishes:
1. Output saved to `agents/<name>/output.log`
2. Agent status derived from `engine/dispatch.json` (done/error/working)
3. Work item status updated (done/failed, with auto-retry up to 3x)
4. PRs auto-synced from output → correct project's `pull-requests.json` (per-URL matching)
5. "No PR" detection — implement/fix tasks that complete without creating a PR get flagged (`noPr: true`)
6. Plan completion check — if all PRD items done, creates verification task + archives plan
7. Agent history updated (last 20 tasks)
8. Quality metrics updated (tokens, cost, approval rates)
9. Review feedback created for PR authors (if review task)
10. Learnings checked in `notes/inbox/`
11. Skills auto-extracted from ` ```skill ` blocks in output
12. Temp files cleaned up

## Team

| Agent | Role | Best for |
|-------|------|----------|
| Ripley | Lead / Explorer | Code review, architecture, exploration |
| Dallas | Engineer | Features, tests, UI |
| Lambert | Analyst | PRD generation, docs |
| Rebecca | Architect | Complex systems, CI/infra |
| Ralph | Engineer | Features, bug fixes |

Routing rules in `routing.md`. Charters in `agents/{name}/charter.md`. Both are editable — customize agents and routing to fit your team's needs.

## Playbooks

| Playbook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `work-item.md` | Shared template for all work items (central + per-project) |
| `implement.md` | Build a PRD item in a git worktree, create PR |
| `review.md` | Review a PR, post findings to repo host |
| `fix.md` | Fix review feedback on existing PR branch |
| `explore.md` | Read-only codebase exploration |
| `test.md` | Run tests and report results |
| `build-and-test.md` | Build project and run test suite |
| `plan-to-prd.md` | Convert a plan into PRD gap items |
| `plan.md` | Generate a plan from user request |
| `implement-shared.md` | Implement on a shared branch (multiple agents) |
| `ask.md` | Answer a question about the codebase |
| `verify.md` | Plan completion: build all repos, start webapp, write testing guide |

All playbooks use `{{template_variables}}` filled from project config. The `work-item.md` playbook uses `{{scope_section}}` to inject project-specific or multi-project context. Playbooks are fully customizable — edit them to match your workflow.

## Health Monitoring

### Heartbeat Check (every tick)

Uses `live-output.log` file modification time as a heartbeat:
- **Process alive + recent output** → healthy, keep running
- **Process alive + in blocking tool call** → extended timeout (matches tool's timeout + grace period)
- **Process alive + silent >5min** → hung, kill and mark failed
- **No process + silent >5min** → orphaned (engine restarted), mark failed

Agents can run for hours as long as they're producing output. The `heartbeatTimeout` (default 5min) only triggers on silence. When an agent is in a blocking tool call (e.g., `TaskOutput` with `block:true`, `Bash` with long timeout), the engine detects this from the live output and extends the timeout automatically.

### Automated Cleanup (every 10 ticks)

| What | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| Temp prompt/sysprompt files | >1 hour old |
| `live-output.log` for idle agents | >1 hour old |
| Git worktrees for merged/abandoned PRs | PR status is `merged`/`abandoned`/`completed` |
| Orphaned worktrees | >24 hours old, no active dispatch references them |
| Zombie processes | In memory but no matching dispatch |

Manual cleanup: `squad cleanup`

## Self-Improvement Loop

Six mechanisms that make the squad get better over time:

### 1. Learnings Inbox → notes.md
Agents write findings to `notes/inbox/`. Engine consolidates at 5+ files using Haiku LLM summarization (regex fallback) into `notes.md` — categorized with source references. Auto-prunes at 50KB. Injected into every future playbook.

### 6. Knowledge Base
`knowledge/` stores full notes by category: architecture, conventions, project-notes, build-reports, reviews. Browsable in dashboard with inline Q&A (Haiku-powered).

### 2. Per-Agent History
`agents/{name}/history.md` tracks last 20 tasks with timestamps, results, projects, and branches. Injected into the agent's system prompt so it remembers past work.

### 3. Review Feedback Loop
When a reviewer flags issues, the engine creates `feedback-<author>-from-<reviewer>.md` in the inbox. The PR author sees the feedback in their next task.

### 4. Quality Metrics
`engine/metrics.json` tracks per agent: tasks completed, errors, PRs created/approved/rejected, reviews done. Visible in CLI (`status`) and dashboard with color-coded approval rates.

### 5. Skills
Agents save repeatable workflows to `skills/<name>.md` with Claude Code-compatible frontmatter. Engine builds an index injected into all prompts. Skills can also be stored per-project at `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (requires a PR). Visible in the dashboard Skills section.

See `docs/self-improvement.md` for the full breakdown.

## Configuration Reference

Engine behavior is controlled via `config.json`. Key settings:

```json
{
  "engine": {
    "tickInterval": 60000,
    "maxConcurrent": 3,
    "agentTimeout": 18000000,
    "heartbeatTimeout": 300000,
    "maxTurns": 100,
    "inboxConsolidateThreshold": 5
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `tickInterval` | 60000 (1min) | Milliseconds between engine ticks |
| `maxConcurrent` | 3 | Max agents running simultaneously |
| `agentTimeout` | 18000000 (5h) | Max total agent runtime |
| `heartbeatTimeout` | 300000 (5min) | Kill agents silent longer than this |
| `maxTurns` | 100 | Max Claude CLI turns per agent session |
| `inboxConsolidateThreshold` | 5 | Inbox files needed before consolidation |
| `worktreeRoot` | `../worktrees` | Where git worktrees are created |
| `idleAlertMinutes` | 15 | Alert after no dispatch for this many minutes |
| `restartGracePeriod` | 1200000 (20min) | Grace period for agent re-attachment after engine restart |

## Node.js Upgrade Caution

The engine and all spawned agents use the Node binary that started the engine (`process.execPath`). After upgrading Node, restart the engine:

```bash
squad stop
squad start
```

## Portability

**Portable (works on any machine):** Engine code, dashboard, playbooks, charters, docs, `config.template.json`.

**Machine-specific (reconfigure per machine):**
- `config.json` — contains absolute paths to project directories. Re-link via `squad add <dir>`.

**Generated at runtime:** routing, notes, knowledge, skills, plans, PRDs, work items, dispatch queue, metrics — all created by the engine as agents work.

To move to a new machine: `npm install -g @yemi33/squad && squad init --force`, then re-run `squad add` for each project.
