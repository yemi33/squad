## Instructions

This is a **test/build/run task**. Your goal is to build, run, test, or verify something — NOT to create new features or PRs.

1. **Navigate** to the correct project directory
2. **If the task references a branch or PR**, check it out in a worktree:
   ```bash
   cd {{project_path}}
   git worktree add ../worktrees/test-{{item_id}} <branch-name>
   cd ../worktrees/test-{{item_id}}
   ```
3. **Build** the project — follow the repo's build instructions (check CLAUDE.md, package.json, README)
4. **Run** if the task asks for it (e.g., `yarn start`, `yarn dev`, docker-compose, etc.)
5. **Test** if the task asks for it (e.g., `yarn test`, `pytest`, etc.)
6. **Report results** — what worked, what failed, build output, test results, localhost URL if running

## Rules

- **Do NOT create pull requests** — this is a test/verification task only
- **Do NOT push commits** unless the task explicitly asks you to fix something
- **Do NOT modify code** unless the task explicitly asks for a fix
- Use PowerShell for build commands on Windows if applicable
- If a build or test fails, report the error clearly — don't try to fix it unless asked
- If running a local server, report the URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)

## Run Command (IMPORTANT)

When the build succeeds and the task involves running a server or app, you MUST output a ready-to-paste run command using **absolute paths** so the user can launch it from any terminal. Format it exactly like this:

```
## Run Command
cd <absolute-path-to-project-or-worktree> && <exact command to start the server>
```

Example: `cd C:/Users/you/my-project && yarn dev`

The agent process terminates after completion, so any dev server you start will die with it. The user needs this command to run it themselves.

## After Completion

Write your findings to: `{{team_root}}/decisions/inbox/{{agent_id}}-{{item_id}}-{{date}}.md`

Include:
- Build status (pass/fail)
- Test results if applicable
- Any errors or warnings
- The run command (absolute paths, copy-pasteable from any terminal)
- Localhost URL if applicable

**Note:** Do NOT write to `agents/*/status.json` — the engine manages your status automatically.

## Cleanup

If you created a worktree, clean it up when done:
```bash
cd {{project_path}}
git worktree remove ../worktrees/test-{{item_id}} --force
```
