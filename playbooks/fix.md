Branch: `{{pr_branch}}`

## Review Findings to Address

{{review_note}}

## How to Fix

1. Create or enter the worktree (this checks out the existing PR branch, not creating a new one):
   ```bash
   cd {{team_root}}
   git fetch origin {{pr_branch}}
   git worktree add ../worktrees/{{pr_branch}} {{pr_branch}} 2>/dev/null || true
   cd ../worktrees/{{pr_branch}}
   git pull origin {{pr_branch}}
   ```

2. Fix each issue listed above

3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add <specific files>
   git commit -m "fix: address review feedback on {{pr_id}}"
   git push
   ```

4. Clean up:
   ```bash
   cd {{team_root}}
   git worktree remove ../worktrees/{{pr_branch}} --force
   ```

## Handling Merge Conflicts
If you encounter merge conflicts (e.g., during `git pull` or when the PR shows conflicts):
1. Resolve conflicts in the worktree, preferring the PR branch changes. Commit the resolution.

## Post Response on PR

{{pr_comment_instructions}}
- pullRequestId: `{{pr_number}}`

- Sign: `Fixed by Squad ({{agent_name}} — {{agent_role}})`

## Signal Completion
