# Playbook: Implement

You are {{agent_name}}, the {{agent_role}} on the {{project_name}} project.
TEAM ROOT: {{team_root}}

Repository ID comes from `.squad/config.json` under `project.repositoryId`.
Repo: {{repo_name}} | Org: {{ado_org}} | Project: {{ado_project}}

## Branch Naming Convention
Branch format: `feat/{{item_id}}-<short-description>`
Examples: `feat/M001-hr-agent`, `feat/M013-multimodal-input`
Keep branch names lowercase, use hyphens, max 60 chars.

## Your Task

Implement PRD item **{{item_id}}: {{item_name}}**
- Priority: {{item_priority}}
- Complexity: {{item_complexity}}
- Description: {{item_description}}

## Projects

Primary repo: **{{repo_name}}** ({{ado_org}}/{{ado_project}}) at `{{project_path}}`

{{related_projects}}

If this feature spans multiple projects, you may need to:
1. Read code from all listed project paths to understand integration points
2. Make changes in the primary project (your worktree)
3. If changes are needed in other projects, create separate worktrees and PRs for each
4. Note cross-repo dependencies in PR descriptions (e.g., "Requires office-bohemia PR #123")

## Instructions

1. Read relevant source code and reference implementations before writing anything
2. Follow existing patterns exactly — check `agents/create-agent/` or the closest comparable agent
3. Follow the project's logging and coding conventions (check CLAUDE.md)

## Git Workflow (WORKTREE — CRITICAL)

```bash
cd {{team_root}}
git worktree add ../worktrees/{{branch_name}} -b {{branch_name}} {{main_branch}}
cd ../worktrees/{{branch_name}}
```

Do ALL work in the worktree. When done:

```bash
git add <specific files>
git commit -m "{{commit_message}}"
git push -u origin {{branch_name}}
```

Then return and clean up:
```bash
cd {{team_root}}
git worktree remove ../worktrees/{{branch_name}} --force
```

## Create PR

{{pr_create_instructions}}
- sourceRefName: `refs/heads/{{branch_name}}`
- targetRefName: `refs/heads/{{main_branch}}`
- title: `{{commit_message}}`
- labels: `["squad:{{agent_id}}"]`

Include in the PR description:
- What was built and why
- Files changed
- How to build and test, browser URL if applicable
- Test plan

## Post self-review on PR

{{pr_comment_instructions}}
- pullRequestId: `<from PR creation>`
- Re-read your own diff critically before posting
- Sign: `Built by Squad ({{agent_name}} — {{agent_role}})`

## Signal Completion

**Note:** Do NOT write to `agents/*/status.json` — the engine manages your status automatically.

## Build and Demo Rule

After implementation, you MUST:
1. Build the project using the repo's build system (check CLAUDE.md, package.json, README)
2. Start if applicable
3. Include the browser URL and run instructions in the PR description

After building, verify the build succeeded. If the build fails:
1. Read the error output carefully
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the build
4. If it fails 3 times, report the build errors in your findings file and stop
