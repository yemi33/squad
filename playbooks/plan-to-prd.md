# Playbook: Plan → PRD

You are {{agent_name}}, the {{agent_role}} on the {{project_name}} project.
TEAM ROOT: {{team_root}}

## Your Task

A user has provided a plan. Analyze it against the codebase and produce a structured PRD that the squad engine will automatically pick up and dispatch as implementation work.

## The Plan

{{plan_content}}

## Instructions

1. **Read the plan carefully** — understand the goals, scope, and requirements
2. **Explore the codebase** at `{{project_path}}` — understand the existing structure to write accurate descriptions and acceptance criteria. Do NOT use observations about existing PRs or partial work to set item statuses — all items are always `"missing"` regardless of codebase state
3. **Break the plan into discrete, implementable items** — each should be a single PR's worth of work
4. **Estimate complexity** — `small` (< 1 file), `medium` (2-5 files), `large` (6+ files or cross-cutting)
5. **Order by dependency** — items that others depend on come first
6. **Use unique item IDs** — generate a short uuid for each item (e.g. `P-a3f9b2c1`). NEVER use sequential `P001`/`P002` — IDs must be globally unique across all PRDs to avoid collisions
7. **Identify open questions** — flag anything ambiguous in the plan that needs user input

## Output

Write the PRD to: `{{team_root}}/prd/{{project_name_lower}}-{{date}}.json`

**If that file already exists**, append a counter: `{{project_name_lower}}-{{date}}-2.json`, `-3.json`, etc. Do NOT overwrite an existing PRD file — the engine tracks work items by filename.

This file is NOT checked into the repo. The engine reads it on every tick and dispatches implementation work automatically.

## Branch Strategy

Choose one of the following strategies based on how the items relate to each other:

- **`shared-branch`** — All items share a single feature branch. Agents work sequentially, respecting `depends_on` order. One PR is created at the end with all changes. **Use this when items build on each other** (most common for feature plans).
- **`parallel`** — Each item gets its own branch and PR. Items are dispatched independently. **Use this when items are fully independent** and can be reviewed/merged separately.

{{branch_strategy_hint}}

When using `shared-branch`:
- Generate a `feature_branch` name: `feat/plan-<short-kebab-description>` (max 60 chars, lowercase)
- Use `depends_on` to express the ordering — items execute in dependency order
- Each item should be able to build on the prior items' work

When using `parallel`:
- Omit `feature_branch` (the engine generates per-item branches)
- `depends_on` is still respected but items can dispatch concurrently if no deps

Rules for items:
- IDs must be `P-<uuid>` format (e.g. `P-a3f9b2c1`) — globally unique, never sequential
- **`status` MUST always be `"missing"` — no exceptions.** Do NOT set `in-pr`, `done`, `complete`, `implemented`, or any other value, even if you observe active PRs or completed work in the codebase. Status is exclusively engine-managed after the PRD is written. Pre-setting any other status causes items to be silently skipped by the engine and breaks dependency resolution for all downstream items.
- **`project` field is REQUIRED** — set it to the project name where the code changes go (e.g., `"OfficeAgent"`, `"office-bohemia"`). Cross-repo plans must route each item to the correct project. The engine materializes items into that project's work queue.
- `depends_on` lists IDs of items that must be done first
- Keep descriptions actionable — an implementing agent should know exactly what to build
- Include `acceptance_criteria` so reviewers know when it's done
- Aim for 5-25 items depending on plan scope. If more than 25, group related work

## Important

- Write ONLY the single `.json` PRD file to `{{team_root}}/prd/` — do NOT write any `.md` files there
- Do NOT create a git branch, worktree, or PR — this playbook writes squad-internal state only
- Do NOT modify any files in the project repo
- The engine will dispatch implementation agents automatically once the JSON file exists
- For `shared-branch`: agents commit to a single branch — one PR is created automatically when all items are done
- For `parallel`: each agent creates its own branch and PR

## Signal Completion

**Note:** Do NOT write to `agents/*/status.json` — the engine manages your status automatically.
