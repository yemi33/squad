All notable changes to Squad are documented here. Versions are auto-published to npm on each sync.

## 0.2.x (2026-03-15)

### Upgrade System
- **Smart upgrade** — `squad init --force` now copies new files, updates engine code, and preserves user customizations
- **Version tracking** — `.squad-version` file tracks installed version for upgrade detection
- **`squad version`** — shows installed vs package version, prompts to upgrade if outdated
- **Upgrade summary** — shows what was updated, added, and preserved during upgrade
- **New files auto-added** — new playbooks, charters, and docs added in updates are automatically installed

### Engine
- **`/plan` command** — full pipeline: feature description → PRD items → agent dispatch across projects
- **Shared feature branches** — dependency-aware dispatch ensures agents work on the same branch
- **Human PR feedback loop** — `@squad` comments on PRs trigger agent fix tasks
- **Squad-level PRD** — multi-project PRD support
- **`/ask` command** — ask questions via Command Center, get answers in inbox
- **Auto-detect user questions** — drop `ask-*.md` files in inbox, engine routes to an agent
- **Solo reviewer skip** — `@squad` keyword not required when you're the only reviewer
- **Knowledge base** — categorized agent learnings stored in `knowledge/` (architecture, conventions, reviews, etc.)
- **Command Center** — persistent multi-turn Sonnet sessions with full squad awareness and tool access
- **Zombie engine elimination** — EPERM file lock fixes, stale PID detection, Windows-safe atomic writes
- **ADO token auto-refresh** — handles expired Azure DevOps authentication tokens
- **Cooldown system** — prevents re-dispatching recently completed work
- **Post-merge cleanup** — automatically marks work items done when PRs merge
- **Fan-out timeout** — configurable timeout for parallel multi-agent dispatches

### Dashboard
- **Responsive layout** — tablet and mobile breakpoints
- **Mention popup** — Tab cycling, wrap-around navigation, repositioned below input
- **Ghost-style send button** — cleaner Command Center UI
- **Platform-aware launches** — browser and file manager commands adapt to OS
- **Health check endpoint** — `/api/health` for monitoring

### Distribution
- **npm package `@yemi33/squad`** — install with `npm install -g @yemi33/squad`
- **Unified CLI** — single `squad` command for all operations
- **GitHub Action** — auto-publishes to npm on every push to master
- **ADO integration docs** — Azure DevOps MCP server setup instructions in README
