# Auto-Discovery & Execution Pipeline

How the squad engine finds work and dispatches agents automatically.

## The Tick Loop

The engine runs a tick every 60 seconds (configurable via `config.json` → `engine.tickInterval`). Each tick:

```
tick()
  1. checkTimeouts()      Kill stale/hung agents (>30min or >10min timeout)
  2. consolidateInbox()   Merge learnings into decisions.md (at 5+ inbox files)
  3. discoverWork()       Scan ALL linked projects for new tasks
  4. updateSnapshot()     Write identity/now.md
  5. dispatch             Spawn agents for pending items (up to maxConcurrent)
```

## Work Discovery

`discoverWork()` iterates every project in `config.projects[]` and runs three discovery functions per project. Results are prioritized: fixes > reviews > implements > work-items.

### Source 1: Pull Requests (`discoverFromPrs`)

**Reads:** `<project>/.squad/pull-requests.json`

| PR State | Action | Dispatch Type |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `reviewStatus: "pending"` or `"waiting"` | Queue a code review | `review` |
| `reviewStatus: "changes-requested"` | Route back to author for fixes | `fix` |

Skips PRs where `status !== "active"`.

### Source 2: PRD Gap Analysis (`discoverFromPrd`)

**Reads:** `<project>/docs/prd-gaps.json` (or custom path from `workSources.prd.path`)

| Item State | Action | Dispatch Type |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| `status: "missing"` or `"planned"` | Queue implementation | `implement` |
| `estimated_complexity: "large"` | Routes to `implement:large` (prefers Rebecca) | `implement:large` |

### Source 3: Per-Project Work Items (`discoverFromWorkItems`)

**Reads:** `<project>/.squad/work-items.json`

| Item State | Action | Dispatch Type |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| `status: "queued"` or `"pending"` | Queue based on item's `type` field | Item's `type` (default: `implement`) |

After dispatching, the engine writes `status: "dispatched"` back to the item. The agent is scoped to the specific project directory.

### Source 4: Central Work Items (`discoverCentralWorkItems`)

**Reads:** `~/.squad/work-items.json` (central, project-agnostic)

These are tasks where the agent decides which project to work in. The engine builds a prompt that includes a list of all linked projects with their paths and repo config. The agent then navigates to the appropriate project directory based on the task.

| Item State | Action | Dispatch Type |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| `status: "queued"` or `"pending"` | Queue based on item's `type` field | Item's `type` (default: `implement`) |

**How it differs from per-project work items:**
- No `cwd` is set — agent starts in the squad directory and navigates itself
- The prompt includes all project paths and **descriptions** so the agent can choose
- No branch/worktree is pre-created — agent handles this
- Useful for cross-project tasks, exploratory work, or when you don't know which repo is relevant

**Project descriptions drive routing.** Each project in `config.json` has a `description` field. The engine injects these into the central work item prompt:

```
### MyProject
- **Path:** C:/Users/you/MyProject
- **Repo:** org/project/MyProject
- **What it is:** Description from config.json...
```

Better descriptions → better agent routing. Describe what each repo contains, what kind of work happens there, and what technologies it uses.

**Cross-repo tasks.** Central work items can span multiple repositories. The agent's prompt instructs it to:
1. Determine all repos affected by the task
2. Work on each sequentially (worktree → commit → push → PR per repo)
3. Note cross-repo dependencies in PR descriptions (e.g., "Requires MyProject PR #456")
4. Use the correct repo config (org, project, repoId) for each repo
5. Document which repos were touched in the learnings file

This means a single work item like "Add telemetry to the document creation pipeline" can result in PRs across multiple repos if the agent determines the change touches shared modules in one repo and the frontend in another.

**Adding central work items:**
- Dashboard Command Center → set Project dropdown to "Auto (agent decides)"
- CLI: `node engine.js work "task title"` (defaults to central queue)
- Direct edit: `~/.squad/work-items.json`

## Discovery Gates

Every discovered item passes through three gates before being queued:

```
Item found
  │
  ├─ isAlreadyDispatched(key)?  → skip if already in pending or active queue
  │    Key format: <source>-<projectName>-<itemId>
  │    e.g., "prd-MyProject-M001", "review-MyRepo-PR-123"
  │
  ├─ isOnCooldown(key)?         → skip if dispatched within cooldown window
  │    Default: 30min for PRD/PRs, 0 for work-items
  │    Cooldowns are in-memory (reset on engine restart)
  │
  └─ resolveAgent(workType)?    → skip if no idle agent available
       Checks routing.md: preferred → fallback → any idle agent
```

## Agent Routing

`resolveAgent()` parses `routing.md` to pick the right agent:

```
routing.md table:
  implement       → dallas  (fallback: ralph)
  implement:large → rebecca (fallback: dallas)
  review          → ripley  (fallback: lambert)
  fix             → _author_ (fallback: dallas)   ← routes to PR author
  analyze         → lambert (fallback: rebecca)
  explore         → ripley  (fallback: rebecca)
  test            → dallas  (fallback: ralph)
```

Resolution order:
1. Check if **preferred** agent is idle → use it
2. Check if **fallback** agent is idle → use it
3. Check **any** agent that's idle → use it
4. If all busy → return null, item stays undiscovered until next tick

## Dispatch Queue

Discovered items land in `engine/dispatch.json`:

```json
{
  "pending": [ ... ],    // Waiting to be spawned
  "active": [ ... ],     // Currently running
  "completed": [ ... ]   // Finished (last 100 kept)
}
```

Each tick, the engine checks available slots:

```
slotsAvailable = maxConcurrent (3) - activeCount
```

It takes up to `slotsAvailable` items from pending and spawns them. Items are processed in discovery-priority order (fixes first, then reviews, then implements, then work-items).

## Execution: spawnAgent()

When an item is dispatched:

### 1. Resolve Project Context
```
meta.project.localPath → rootDir (the repo on disk)
```

### 2. Create Git Worktree (if task has a branch)
```
git worktree add <rootDir>/../worktrees/<branch> -b <branch> <mainBranch>
```
- Branch names are sanitized (alphanumeric, dots, hyphens, slashes only, max 200 chars)
- If worktree fails for implement/fix → item marked as error, moved to completed
- If worktree fails for review/analyze → falls back to rootDir (read-only tasks)

### 3. Render Playbook
```
playbooks/<type>.md  →  substitute {{variables}}  →  append decisions.md  →  append learnings requirement
```

Variables injected from config and item metadata:
- `{{project_name}}`, `{{ado_org}}`, `{{ado_project}}`, `{{repo_name}}` — from project config
- `{{agent_name}}`, `{{agent_id}}`, `{{agent_role}}` — from agent roster
- `{{item_id}}`, `{{item_name}}`, `{{branch_name}}`, `{{repo_id}}` — from work item
- `{{team_root}}` — path to central `.squad/` directory

### 4. Build System Prompt
Combines:
- Agent identity (name, role, skills)
- Agent charter (`agents/<name>/charter.md`)
- Project context (repo name, repo host config, main branch)
- Critical rules (worktrees, MCP tools, PowerShell, learnings)
- Full `decisions.md` content

### 5. Spawn Claude CLI
```bash
claude -p <prompt-file> --system-prompt <sysprompt-file> \
  --output-format json --max-turns 100 --verbose \
  --allowedTools Edit,Write,Read,Bash,Glob,Grep,Agent,WebFetch,WebSearch
```

- Process runs in the worktree directory (or rootDir for reviews)
- stdout/stderr captured (capped at 1MB each)
- CLAUDECODE env vars stripped to allow nested sessions

### 6. Track State
- Agent status → `working` in `agents/<name>/status.json`
- Dispatch item → moved from `pending` to `active` in `dispatch.json`
- Process tracked in `activeProcesses` Map for timeout monitoring

## Post-Completion

When the claude process exits:

```
proc.on('close')
  │
  ├─ Save output to agents/<name>/output.log
  │
  ├─ Set agent status to "done" (exit 0) or "error" (non-zero)
  │
  ├─ Move dispatch item: active → completed
  │
  ├─ Post-completion hooks:
  │    review → update PR reviewStatus in pull-requests.json
  │    fix    → set PR reviewStatus back to "waiting"
  │
  ├─ Check for learnings in decisions/inbox/
  │    (warns if agent didn't write findings)
  │
  └─ Clean up temp prompt files from engine/
```

```

## Timeout & Stale Detection

Two layers of protection:

**Agent timeout** (`engine.agentTimeout`, default 10min):
- Checks `activeProcesses` Map for elapsed time
- Sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 5s

**Stale detection** (`engine.staleThreshold`, default 30min):
- Scans `dispatch.active` for items where `started_at` exceeds threshold
- Catches cases where the process exited but dispatch wasn't cleaned up
- Kills process if still tracked, marks dispatch as error, resets agent to idle

## Cooldown Behavior

| Source | Default Cooldown | Behavior |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| PRD items | 30 minutes | After dispatching M001, won't re-discover it for 30min |
| Pull requests | 30 minutes | After dispatching a review, won't re-queue for 30min |
| Work items | 0 (immediate) | No cooldown, but item status changes to "dispatched" |

Cooldowns are **in-memory only**. On engine restart, `isAlreadyDispatched()` still prevents duplicates by checking the pending/active queue in `dispatch.json`. The cooldown just prevents rapid re-discovery within a single engine session.

## Configuration Reference

All discovery behavior is controlled via `config.json`:

```json
{
  "engine": {
    "tickInterval": 60000,       // ms between ticks
    "maxConcurrent": 3,          // max agents running at once
    "agentTimeout": 600000,      // 10min — kill hung processes
    "staleThreshold": 1800000,   // 30min — kill stale dispatches
    "maxTurns": 100              // max claude CLI turns per agent
  },
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "MyProject",
      "localPath": "C:/Users/you/MyProject",
      "workSources": {
        "prd": {
          "enabled": true,
          "path": "docs/prd-gaps.json",
          "itemFilter": { "status": ["missing", "planned"] },
          "cooldownMinutes": 30
        },
        "pullRequests": {
          "enabled": true,
          "path": ".squad/pull-requests.json",
          "cooldownMinutes": 30
        },
        "workItems": {
          "enabled": true,
          "path": ".squad/work-items.json",
          "cooldownMinutes": 0
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To disable a work source for a project, set `"enabled": false`. To change where the engine looks for PRD or PR files, change the `path` field (resolved relative to `localPath`).
