# Sync to Personal Skill

Pushes a sanitized version of the squad repo to the `personal` remote, stripping all session-specific logs and history while preserving the core framework.

## When to Use

- User says "sync to personal", "update personal repo", "push clean to personal"
- User wants to distribute a clean copy of the squad framework

## Workflow

### 1. Ensure personal remote exists

```bash
git remote get-url personal 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: no 'personal' remote configured. Add one with: git remote add personal https://github.com/<user>/squad.git"
```

### 2. Create a temporary sanitized branch

```bash
git checkout -b dist-clean
```

### 3. Remove ephemeral/session files from the index

These files contain runtime logs, session history, and machine-specific state:

```bash
# Agent history files
git rm --cached agents/*/history.md 2>/dev/null

# Decision archives and inbox
git rm -r --cached decisions/archive/ decisions/inbox/ 2>/dev/null

# Runtime state files
git rm --cached decisions.md work-items.json 2>/dev/null

# Notes (session-specific exploration artifacts)
git rm -r --cached notes/ 2>/dev/null

# Internal project instructions (org-specific context)
git rm --cached CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
```

### 4. Ensure .gitignore excludes these on the clean branch

The `.gitignore` on the dist-clean branch should include:

```
# Session logs and history (stripped for distribution)
agents/*/history.md
decisions/archive/
decisions/inbox/
decisions.md
work-items.json
notes/
CLAUDE.md
```

If these lines are not already present, add them. If they are (from a previous sync), skip this step.

### 5. Check for hardcoded values

Before committing, scan for machine/user-specific values that shouldn't be distributed:

```bash
# Check for hardcoded usernames or absolute paths in distributable files
grep -rn "C:/Users/\|C:\\\\Users\\\\" --include="*.js" --include="*.html" --include="*.md" \
  --exclude-dir=decisions --exclude-dir=.claude | grep -v config.json | grep -v node_modules
```

If found, replace with dynamic alternatives:
- Hardcoded usernames → `os.userInfo().username` (JS) or `<your-user>` placeholder (docs)
- Absolute paths → relative paths or config-driven values
- Org-specific URLs → config-driven values

**Note:** `config.json` is expected to have machine-specific paths (users re-link via `squad.js add`). `config.template.json` exists as the distributable reference.

### 6. Preserve empty directories with .gitkeep

```bash
touch decisions/archive/.gitkeep decisions/inbox/.gitkeep
git add -f decisions/archive/.gitkeep decisions/inbox/.gitkeep
```

### 7. Commit and force push to personal

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Strip logs, history, and decisions for clean distribution"
git push personal dist-clean:master --force
```

### 8. Switch back to master and clean up

```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D dist-clean
```

### 9. Handle auth if push fails

If push fails due to Enterprise Managed User restrictions:
```bash
gh auth login --hostname github.com --web
# Authenticate as personal account, push, then re-auth as org account
```

## Files Stripped

| Category | Pattern | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Agent history | `agents/*/history.md` | Session-specific conversation logs |
| Decision archive | `decisions/archive/*` | Historical decision records |
| Decision inbox | `decisions/inbox/*` | Pending session decisions |
| Decisions summary | `decisions.md` | Synthesized runtime decisions |
| Work items | `work-items.json` | Runtime dispatch tracking |
| Notes | `notes/*` | Session-specific exploration artifacts |
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | Org-specific context (repo remote purposes, internal notes) |

## Files Preserved

- `agents/*/charter.md` — Agent role definitions (core framework)
- `engine/` code — The engine scripts and CLI
- `identity/` templates — Identity and role definitions
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` — Documentation
- All `.js` files — Engine implementation

## Hardcoded Values to Watch

| File | What | Fix |
|------|------|-----|
| `dashboard.js` | Default author in decisions | Use `os.userInfo().username` |
| `dashboard.html` | Author field in forms | Leave empty (server fills in) |
| `README.md` | Clone URLs | Use `<your-user>` placeholder |
| `config.json` | Absolute paths, repo IDs, org URLs | Expected — users reconfigure via `squad.js add` |

## Important Notes

- Always force push to personal since the history is rewritten each time
- Never modify the `origin` remote or `master` branch during this process
- The `.gitignore` changes only apply to the dist-clean branch, not master
- The personal remote URL is read from git config — never hardcode it in this skill
