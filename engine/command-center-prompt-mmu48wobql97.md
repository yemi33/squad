M365 Cowork — MOS Catalog Onboarding Guide
How to register M365 Cowork (backed by OfficeAgent) in the MOS3 catalog so it appears in the M365 Copilot left rail, without any Sydney/TuringBot dependency.


1. Context
OfficeAgent runs on its own TypeScript/Node.js infrastructure (ISS repo), not on Sydney/TuringBot or MCS Aether. The standard MOS onboarding docs assume a Sydney Helix agent, but MOS doesn't require Sydney. Two production agents already prove this:

Agent	Backend	MOS Type	Custom Experience
Cowork Weave	MCS Aether Runtime	DeclarativeCopilot	Weave
DeepWork	Sydney (but with custom UX)	DeclarativeCopilot	Deepwork
Workflows	Sydney (but with custom UX)	DeclarativeCopilot	Workflows
M365 Cowork	OfficeAgent (ISS)	DeclarativeCopilot	M365Cowork

All four follow the same pattern: upload a UAP to MOS, declare a customExperience, and the client loads a federated UX module instead of default chat.


2. What You Need

Artifact	Purpose	Who Creates
Unified Application Package (UAP)	.zip containing manifest + icons, uploaded to MOS	William Li <liwilliam@microsoft.com>
TitleId	Assigned by MOS on upload, identifies your agent globally	MOS (automatic)
Custom Experience client handler	1JS/midgard code that loads your UX when the client sees "M365Cowork"	1JS team (partnership) William Li <liwilliam@microsoft.com>
Federated UX module	Skill picker + chat UI served from CDN	William Li <liwilliam@microsoft.com>
OfficeAgent backend	Pages skills + LWS integration	Sachin Rao (Office) <sacra@microsoft.com>



3. Step-by-Step Onboarding
Step 1: Create the Unified Application Package
The UAP is a .zip with three files:
appPackage/
├── manifest.json          ← Unified Application Manifest
├── declarativeAgent.json  ← Declarative Agent Manifest
├── color.png              ← 192x192 color icon
└── outline.png            ← 32x32 outline icon


manifest.json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.17/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.17",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "YOUR-APP-GUID-HERE",
  "developer": {
    "name": "Microsoft Corporation",
    "websiteUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com",
    "privacyUrl": "https://privacy.microsoft.com",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement"
  },
  "name": {
    "short": "M365 Cowork",
    "full": "M365 Cowork — Rich Content Pages"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Create reports, webpages, briefs, trackers, and newsletters as Copilot Pages",
    "full": "A document creation agent that generates structured, shareable Copilot Pages from natural language. Supports reports, webpages, executive briefs, project trackers, and newsletters with full HTML rendering."
  },
  "icons": {
    "color": "color.png",
    "outline": "outline.png"
  },
  "accentColor": "#0078D4",
  "copilotAgents": {
    "declarativeAgents": [
      {
        "$ref": "declarativeAgent.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}


declarativeAgent.json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/copilot/declarative-agent/v1.4/schema.json",
  "version": "v1.4",
  "id": "m365Cowork",
  "name": "M365 Cowork",
  "description": "Create rich content pages — reports, webpages, briefs, trackers, newsletters",
  "instructions": "You are a document creation agent that generates structured Copilot Pages using the Loop Web Service.",
  "conversation_starters": [
    { "title": "Create a report", "text": "Create a weekly status report for my project" },
    { "title": "Create a webpage", "text": "Build a project portal page for my team" },
    { "title": "Create a brief", "text": "Write an executive summary of this quarter's results" },
    { "title": "Create a tracker", "text": "Set up an OKR tracking page for Q2" }
  ],
  "behavior_overrides": {
    "x-custom_experience": {
      "name": "M365Cowork"
    }
  },
  "x-experimental_capabilities": [
    { "name": "CustomExperience" }
  ]
}


Key fields explained:

Field	Value	Why
id	m365Cowork	Package-relative agent ID; combined with TitleId to form the full GPT ID
x-custom_experience.name	M365Cowork	The client matches this string to load your federated UX
x-experimental_capabilities	CustomExperience	Tells /getGptList to add CustomExperience to requiredClientFeatures, hiding the agent on unsupported clients
conversation_starters	Array of suggestions	Shown in the agent's homepage before the user types
instructions	Minimal	Real instructions live in OfficeAgent's SKILL.md files, not the manifest

Step 2: Register in Nexus Portal

Navigate to the Nexus Portal: https://aka.ms/copilot/devx/onboarding
Create a new agent entry
Fill in metadata (name, description, owner, ICM team)
Click Generate MOS Config to auto-generate the UAPOr use the manually crafted UAP from Step 1
Step 3: Upload to MOS Catalog

In the Nexus Portal, click Upload MOS Config
Upload appPackage/build/appPackage.dev.zip
MOS validates the manifest and queues the agent for indexing
MOS sends a shoulder tap to Substrate Search Assistants (SSA)
SSA rebuilds the user app index — agent is discoverable immediately
Step 4: Receive TitleId
MOS assigns a TitleId on successful upload:
T_<guid>

Example: T_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890


The full GPT ID becomes:
T_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.m365Cowork


You do NOT need to add this to Sydney's AgentTitleIdConfig.ini because:

That file maps TitleIds to Sydney agent names for Sydney's internal routing
Your agent runs on OfficeAgent, not Sydney
Sydney's MetaOsGptProvider returns your agent metadata to the client via /getGptList without needing to know how to route it internally
Step 5: Register Custom Experience in 1JS Client
This requires a partnership with the 1JS/midgard team.
The M365 Chat client needs code that says: "When I see customExperience.name = 'M365Cowork', load this UX module."
Following the Cowork Weave pattern, you need a midgard package:
midgard/packages/m365-cowork/
├── src/
│   ├── M365CoworkExperience.tsx   ← Federation shell
│   ├── SkillPicker.tsx                  ← Renders skills.json cards
│   └── constants.ts                     ← CDN URL, version
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json


The federation shell loads your UX from a CDN:
export const M365CoworkExperience: React.FC<Props> = ({
  cdnUrl, version, userId, tenantId, theme, tokenProviders
}) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    initializeFederation({ cdnUrl, version });
  }, [cdnUrl, version]);

  return <FederatedM365Cowork {...props} />;
};


Step 6: Deploy Federated UX to CDN
Your skill picker UI and chat experience are served from Azure Front Door (same pattern as Cowork Weave):
https://officeagentpages-<hash>.azurefd.net/latest/static/js/async/
├── skill-picker.{hash}.js        ← Skill cards UI
├── chat-view.{hash}.js           ← Active conversation renderer
├── page-preview.{hash}.js        ← Inline Copilot Page preview
└── shared-chunk.{hash}.js        ← Common utilities


CDN URL and version are overridable via ECS feature flags for independent deployment.
Step 7: Wire Client to OfficeAgent Backend
The federated UX connects to OfficeAgent via WebSocket (not to Sydney or Aether):
Client (CDN bundles)
    │
    ├── WebSocket connect → OfficeAgent endpoint
    ├── Send: { message: "[skill:create-report] ...", role: "user" }
    ├── Receive: streaming agent responses
    └── Receive: { pageLink: "https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/..." }


Step 8: Ring Progression
Ring progression is controlled in three independent layers:

Layer	Mechanism	How to Configure
MOS catalog	Security groups	Nexus Portal → Ring Settings → Add SG per ring
Client UX	ECS feature flags	featureFlags.m365CoworkCdnUrl, featureFlags.m365CoworkVersion
OfficeAgent backend	Docker deployment	ISS deployment pipeline

Ring order: SDF-Pilot → SDF-Master → MSIT-Pilot → MSIT-Master → WW-Pilot → WW → GCC → DOD


4. What Happens at Runtime
1. User opens M365 Copilot
       │
       ▼
2. Client calls /getGptList API
       │
       ▼
3. Sydney's MetaOsGptProvider queries Entity Serve
   Entity Serve returns agents from user's index, including:
   {
     "gptId": "T_<guid>.m365Cowork",
     "source": "MOS3",
     "type": "DeclarativeCopilot",
     "customExperience": { "name": "M365Cowork" },
     "requiredClientFeatures": ["CustomExperience"]
   }
       │
       ▼
4. Client checks: do I support "CustomExperience"?
   ├── No  → Agent hidden (old clients)
   └── Yes → Read customExperience.name
       │
       ▼
5. Client matches "M365Cowork" → loads federated UX from CDN
       │
       ▼
6. UX reads skills.json → renders skill picker
       │
       ▼
7. User picks skill + types prompt → sent to OfficeAgent (NOT Sydney)
       │
       ▼
8. OfficeAgent processes → creates Copilot Page via LWS
       │
       ▼
9. Returns page link → UX shows inline preview + "Open" button


Sydney's role is purely passthrough — it returns your agent's metadata from Entity Serve to the client. It never processes your requests.


5. What You Do NOT Need in Sydney

Sydney Artifact	Required for Helix Agents	Required for You
AgentTitleIdConfig.ini entry	Yes	No — your backend is OfficeAgent
CompliantAgentName.bond enum	Yes	No
OwnershipServiceTeam.bond enum	Yes	No
BuiltInAgents/{Name}/latest.json	Yes	No
AgentRuntime/Agents/{Name}/releases/	Yes	No
bizchat_enable{Name}.json flight	Yes	No
Any C# code in Sydney	Yes	No

The only Sydney-related system you interact with is the /getGptList API, and that happens automatically — MetaOsGptProvider queries Entity Serve which includes all MOS3 agents.


6. Comparison: How Others Did It
Cowork Weave (Your closest precedent)

Step	What Weave Did	What You Do
UAP	Created with customExperience.name = "Weave"	Same, with "M365Cowork"
MOS upload	Via Nexus Portal	Same
TitleId	T_7e151bfa-7eaa-0802-049f-5d3b98c95e04	You'll get your own
Sydney changes	None	None
Client package	mcs-coworker (federation shell)	Your equivalent package
CDN	coworker-*.azurefd.net	Your CDN
Backend	MCS Aether Runtime (/v1/skills, /v1/messages, SSE)	OfficeAgent (WebSocket, SDK tools)
Backend API	Aether REST + SSE	OfficeAgent WebSocket

DeepWork (Sydney-backed but custom UX)

Step	What DeepWork Did	Difference for You
UAP	customExperience.name = "Deepwork"	Same pattern
Manifest location	Config/Manifests/DeepWork/gpt.json (in Sydney repo)	Your manifest is in the UAP, not in Sydney
Backend	Sydney with Helix runtime	OfficeAgent (no Sydney)
Required client features	FluxV3, ChainOfThoughtExperience	CustomExperience



7. Development & Testing
Local Development (Before MOS Registration)
For local testing, you don't need MOS at all:
1. Run OfficeAgent locally (Docker):
   docker-compose up

2. Point your UX dev server to localhost:
   OFFICEAGENT_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:3000

3. Test skill picker → OfficeAgent → LWS flow end-to-end


Sideloading (Dev Ring Testing)
Use Teams App CLI to sideload without formal MOS approval:
# Package the UAP
cd appPackage && zip -r appPackage.dev.zip manifest.json declarativeAgent.json color.png outline.png

# Sideload to your M365 tenant
teamsapp install --file-path appPackage.dev.zip


Caveats:

Sideloaded apps don't trigger SSA shoulder tap — may take up to 24 hours to appear
x- experimental properties may be stripped during MOS ↔ Teams catalog 24-hour sync
Fine for dev/test, not for production
Integration Testing with M365 Copilot
Once sideloaded or MOS-registered:

Open M365 Copilot (m365.cloud.microsoft)
Check left rail — your agent should appear (after indexing)
Click agent → should load your federated UX (skill picker)
Pick a skill → message should reach OfficeAgent
Verify Copilot Page is created and link returned


8. Indexing & Propagation Timing

Event	Latency
Upload via Nexus Portal	Immediate — MOS sends shoulder tap to SSA
Sideload via Teams App CLI	Up to 24 hours — no shoulder tap
Manifest version bump (re-upload)	Immediate if via Nexus Portal
x- experimental properties	Preserved on direct upload; stripped during 24-hour MOS ↔ Teams catalog sync
User index rebuild	Once per 24 hours (scheduled) or on shoulder tap (immediate)



9. Auth & Permissions
MOS Catalog Upload

Requirement	Details
Azure AD tenant	Must be a Microsoft corporate tenant
Nexus Portal access	Request via https://aka.ms/copilot/devx/onboarding
Teams Admin role	Required for publishing to tenant catalog (not for sideloading)
